GeoHack feature usage
=======

This tab contains feature usage for [GeoHack](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Toolserver:GeoHack), a Wikimedia interface
to geographic data. The only feature currently being tracked is the opening of a page based around GeoHack, which makes
it less-than-useful for comparisons with other interfaces or tools, but very useful for tracking variation in user behaviour.

Events are sampled at a rate of *1%*.

Outages and inaccuracies
------

- **'A'** (2016-04-15): There was a bug in Maps event logging wherein tracking did not work. It was patched on 17 June 2016. See [T138078](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T138078) for more details.
